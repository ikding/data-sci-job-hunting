## Choosing a company

Now is a good time to be a data scientist! 

* Many company want to expand their data science teams. (But not all of them know why.)
* The profession as a whole is receiving a lot of attention (some may say hype.)
* Wide array of open-source tools to choose from. 

The choices of job opportunities can be overwhemling for candidates.

* Scale of the company: startup (early vs. late-stage), established company
* Industry: tech, social network, retail, e-commerce, financial/banking, healthcare, biomedicine, insurance, manufacturing, consulting... etc

## Criteria on choosing a company #1

Advices from [Stitch Fix Blog](http://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2015/03/31/advice-for-data-scientists/):

1. Work for a company that leverages data science for its strategic differentiation:

    Company's core competency depends on its data and analytic capabilities; data science is more than a "supporting role".
    
2. Work for a company with great data:

    There is a difference between "data" and "aspirations of data". Ideally you'll find a company that already has enough data to do interesting things.
    
3. Work for a company with green field opportunities: 

    Look for those companies that have a strong direction and strongly established data science teams, but have an array of problems they are solving for the first time.

---

## Criteria on choosing a company #2

On a more personal level, my criteria is fairly simple:

1. I want to care about what the company is doing.

2. I want to optimize for my own learning opportunities in hands-on data science.

Caveat: "Don't judge a book by its cover".

Be open-minded and throw away preconceived-notion about what you think a company does, or does not, do. (I never thought I'd work for a bank)

## But how do you find out?

Good recruiters and hiring managers have vested interest in presenting their best foot forward.

## But how do you find out?

Ask people who may have more information.

Trust, but verify.

## Importance of Network and Connections

Connections in your professional network can help you by:

* Give you a heads-up on hiring situations (current or future). - "Our executive team is actively raising money now and had good progress; we will get more headcounts next quarter"

* Give you, within reason, an insider-view on a company that you can't discover on the internet. 
    * Good: "Yeah, we are in consulting, but most of our clients are in the same city, so the travel is not that bad."
    
    * Bad: "Yeah, I heard Evil Corp's data engineer recently left, so their data scientist proably have to do both DS and DE's job."
    
    * Worse: "Yeah, the company's engineering staff is undergoing exodus. All the job postings on website are from 6 months ago."
    
* Give you, within reason, suggestions on interview prep.

* Help you evaluate job opportunities and offers

---

## Where to find connections? LinkedIn!

Immediate connections:

* Your current and former colleagues
* Cohorts of data incubator

Extended connections:

* 2nd degree connections on LinkedIn (I found two of my industry jobs this way!)
* It is highly recommended to establish your presence on LinkedIn
* Asking mutual connection for an introduction, then go for informational interviews

---

## Useful websites - Indeed

* A very good job aggregator. 
* You can set up the job alerts so that it will be delivered daily to your email. I set up alerts for "Data Scientist" jobs in San Francisco bay area, that would be a preTy wide net in itself. 
* You can also set up company specific alerts such as: “Company:(Capital One) (Data Scientist OR Data Engineer) jobs”

---

## Useful websites - Glassdoor

* Glassdoor let employees publish anonymous reviews of the employers. 
* I use this website when I am doing research on the company that I am interested in, often before the information and on-site interviews.

---

## Useful websites - Crunchbase

* Crunchbase has a fairly comprehensive list of startups fund-raising.
* Judging from last funding and employee size, you can gauge the length of the runway.
* Useful for startups; not useful for public companies

## A Data Scientist's Interview

"Data science interviews are the worst because data science is interdisciplinary: code for "you have to know everything about all the disciplines."  Depending on the company and the team, your interview might look like a software developer’s interview, or it might look a like a statistician's interview, and the bad news is that virtually none of the material overlaps."

- [Erin Shellman](http://www.erinshellman.com/crushed-it-landing-a-data-science-job/)

## Skills Required

* Stats / Probability
* Data Engineering / System Architecture
* Software Engineering
* Modeling / Machine Learning
* Data Visualization / Web Dev
* Domain Knowledge
* Business Acumen and Communication

Know your skill profile, your interest, and know what the company is looking for. If you found yourself lacking on aspects that the company absolutely need, it's not a good fit.

## Skills Required

Do you excel at all five? Congratulations! You are a mythical creature!

<div style='text-align: center;'>

Reality: 

You don't need a single individual to do all five jobs, but you need to build a team that hopefully will cover all aspects.

## Types of Interviews

* Coding Challenge
* Data Analysis Challenge
* Technical Interview (Phone or On-site)
* Business Interview
* Behavioral Interview

---

## Types of Interviews

Coding Challenge:

You are expected to solve some computation or data manipulation problem, using a language of your choice. Ideally, your solution not only have to be correct, but also have to scale well. If you can solve a problem in O(n) time, don’t solve it in O(n^2). 

Action: play with [HackerRank](http://www.hackerrank.com) or [leetcode](http://www.leetcode.com) (but don't go overboard!)

---

## Types of Interviews

Data Aanalysis Challenge:

Test your skills on data manipulation, cleaning, and predictive modeling. The questions often
contain both descriptive and predictive components. 

Descriptive: What is the average amount of time a bike spends at a station?

Predictive: Please predict the number of bicycles arriving at a specific station during a specific time span.

Things to know:

* You often can stick with simpler models (eg. linear or logistic regression) to solve the problem.
* Your goal was not only to have good grasp on the data munging and modeling, but also provide a written document to explain, in laymen’s terms, what you have found. This is because, as a data scienEst, you are often expected to communicate the results with other non-technical audiences. 
* You must be able to analyze data with code (eg. R, python, and maybe MATLAB) – point-and-clock programs such as Excel won't cut it! I did all my analysis in R and wrote reports in RMarkdown, but Python / iPython notebook will work too. 

Action: Play with [kaggle Titanic challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) to understand the type of questions asked in a data challenge.

## Types of Interviews

Technical Interview (Phone or On-site)

* The technical components of the phone and on-site interviews are usually less hands-on. The interviewers will usually not ask you to derive things since there is not enough time (but YMMV); they may ask you to write short codes on the fly (via screen share or white board) as a mini-version of the coding / data analysis interviews. 

* The questions ranges widely depending on the interviewer, the company, and the position you are applying to. Understand your audience and get an idea of what they are looking for.

* No matter what the questions are asked, it is important to make the interview "interactive". You are talking with a live human being, so most of the time, you not only have to solve the problems correctly, but also have to "think out loud" so that the interviewer can follow your line of thought. This is the conversational version of "show your work". 

Action: conduct mock-up interviews with your friends and colleagues. Know your audience and understand what the company is looking for; but also understand that you probably won't expect any of the questions.

---

## Types of Interviews

Business Case Interviews

* Only some companies have this. You should only prepare for it if you are pretty certain that this will be included in the interview.

* The questions ranges from more number-specific (breakeven analysis: given the following assumptions on fixed and variable costs, how many units of product do you need to sell to break even?) to more open ended questions that involved a lot of back‐and-forth discussions with the interviewers (example: imagine that you have access to half of the US credit card transaction data. How do you use this data to consult your client, a big cafe chain, on which city in US to open their new branches?)

Action: checkout [case interview tutorials](http://www.capitalone.com/careers/analyst/assessment/) available on line, which gives you a flavor of the questions that may be involved.

---

## Types of Interviews

Behavioral Interview:

* The behavioral questions are asked to figure out if you work will with others, how you handle conflicts, etc. Employers would prefer to have a crystal ball to figure out how you will behave in the future, but since they don’t have that, the next best thing they can do is to see how you behaved in the past in order to predict your future with them. 

* But, when you answer this kind of question, it is important to think of examples that back up your answer. Saying "I work well with others"" is one thing; saying "in my last project I worked with three different research groups to bring the project to completion" is much better.

* One popular approach to answer this kind of quesEons is to use the STAR (Situation / Task / Action / Result) format. There are a wide array of internet resources available on this topic, which I won’t bother repeating. 

Action: google "behavioral interview" and understand the STAR format. Think about your past experiences and come up with answers for some popular questions (teamwork, conflict resolution, biggest strengths and weaknesses, etc.)

---

## Types of Interviews

Your question for them:

* A job interview is a two-way process in which two parties (you and your potential employer) decide if they want to "go steady". Once you take their job offer you will likely spend several years with them, so this is not a decision to be taken lightly.

* During the phone and on-site interview, it is also your best chance to ask questions about the company and the job. This not only shows them that you are genuinely interested in the job (and have done your homework before the interview), but also is your best chance to collect information about the company. 

* Ideally you have done some homework before your on‐site interview so that the Q&A time can be spent on things that aren't public knowledge.

---

## Types of Interviews

Example questions for employers:

1. What would be my main responsibility if I am hired? What are some of the example projects I may be working on? 

2. What is your day to day like? 

3. What are the personal attributes that set a successful employee apart from others? 

4. What does a successful first‐year look like for new hire in this position? 

5. How did you start in this company / why did you decide to work here? 

6. Things that you like the most and the least about working at this company? 

7. When can I expect to hear from you after this interview? – ask either the hiring manager or the HR this question to have a better sense about the timeline they make hiring decisions.

## Salary Negotiation

Highly recommended read, especially if you think there will be offers coming: ["Negotiating Your Salary: How To Make $1000 a Minute" (Chapman)](http://www.amazon.com/Negotiating-Your-Salary-Minute-Revised/dp/1580083102)

Older version in electronic format can be found online.

</div>

---

## Salary Negotiation

Salary making rule:

1. Postpone salary talk until there's an offer
2. Don't do salary negotation over the email - phone or in-person preferred
3. Know your market value, your own range, and your BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement).
    * Ideal
    * Satisfactory
    * No-go
