### Criteria on choosing a company

Advices from [Stitch Fix Blog](http://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2015/03/31/advice-for-data-scientists/):

1. Work for a company that leverages data science for its strategic differentiation:

    Company's core competency depends on its data and analytic capabilities; data science is more than a "supporting role".
    
2. Work for a company with great data:

    There is a difference between "data" and "aspirations of data". Ideally you'll find a company that already has enough data to do interesting things.
    
3. Work for a company with green field opportunities:

    Look for those companies that have a strong direction and strongly established data science teams, but have an array of problems they are solving for the first time.

## Criteria on choosing a company

On a more personal level, my criteria is fairly simple:

1. I want to care about what the company is doing.
2. I want to optimize for my own learning opportunities in hands-on data science.

Caveat: "Don't judge a book by its cover".

Be open-minded and throw away preconceived-notion about what you think a company does, or does not, do.

## Misconception on startups #1

Misconception: Startups are the shortcut to the fortune, fame and glory! Look at all these people profiled on techcrunch that become millionaires in their 20s!

Truth: 

1. 75% of the venture capital backed startup fail, so the median of the stock grants is zero. ("Venture capitalists bury their dead very quietly") [1]

2. Even if the company makes it, it's rare for the stock grants to be "life-changing", for someone this early in the career.

## Misconception on startup #2

Misconception: Startup employees will work hard and learn a lot when I join a startup.

Truth: partly true, but your mileage may vary.
