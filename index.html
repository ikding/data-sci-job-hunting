    <h2>Criteria on choosing a company #1</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>Advice from <a href="http://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2015/03/31/advice-for-data-scientists/">Stitch Fix Blog</a>:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Work for a company that leverages data science for its strategic differentiation:</p>

<p>Company&#39;s core competency depends on its data and analytic capabilities; data science is more than a &quot;supporting role&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>Work for a company with great data:</p>

<p>There is a difference between &quot;data&quot; and &quot;aspirations of data&quot;. Ideally you&#39;ll find a company that already has enough data to do interesting things.</p></li>
<li><p>Work for a company with green field opportunities: </p>

<p>Look for those companies that have a strong direction and strongly established data science teams, but have an array of problems they are solving for the first time.</p></li>
</ol>

    <h2>Criteria on choosing a company #2</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>On a more personal level, my criteria are fairly simple:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I want to care about what the company is doing.</p></li>
<li><p>I want to optimize for my own learning opportunities in hands-on data science.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Other considerations: boss/teammates, compensation, work-life balance...</p>

<p>Caveat: &quot;Don&#39;t judge a book by its cover&quot;.</p>

<p>Be open-minded and throw away preconceived-notion about what you think a company does, or does not, do.</p>

<p><strong>Action</strong>: think long and hard about what your own set of criteria is.</p>

    <h2>Importance of Network and Connections</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>Connections in your professional network can help you by:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Give you a heads-up on hiring situations (current or future): &quot;Our executive team is actively raising money now and had good progress; we will get more headcounts next quarter&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Give you, within reason, an insider-view on a company that you can&#39;t discover on the internet. </p>

<ul>
<li>Good: &quot;Yeah, our company is in data science consulting, but most of our clients are in the same city, so the travel is not that bad.&quot;</li>
<li>Bad: &quot;Yeah, I heard Evil Corp&#39;s data engineer recently left, so their data scientist probably have to do both DS and DE&#39;s job.&quot;</li>
<li>Worse: &quot;Yeah, the company&#39;s engineering staff is undergoing exodus. All the job postings on website are from 6 months ago.&quot;</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Give you, within reason, suggestions on interview prep.</p></li>
<li><p>Help you evaluate job opportunities and offers</p></li>

    <h2>Useful websites: LinkedIn (Professional Network)</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li><p>Immediate connections:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your current and former colleagues / classmates</li>
<li>Your friends</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Extended connections:</p>

<ul>
<li>2nd degree connections on LinkedIn</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Example use: (I found two of my industry jobs this way!)</p>

<ul>
<li>Look for 2nd degree connections in a company you are interested in</li>
<li>Asking mutual connection for an introduction, then go for informational interviews and (perhaps) job referrals</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Action</strong>: join LinkedIn, build up your network, and establish a presence.</p>

    <h2>Useful websites: Indeed (Job Posting Aggregator)</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p><strong>Example Use</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can set up the job alerts so that it will be delivered daily to your email. I set up alerts for &quot;Data Scientist&quot; jobs in San Francisco bay area, that would be a pretty wide net in itself. </li>
<li>You can also set up company specific alerts such as: “Company:(Capital One) (Data Scientist OR Data Engineer) jobs”</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Action</strong>: set up job alerts for targeted geographies and/or companies</p>

    <h2>Useful websites - Glassdoor (Employer Reviews)</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>Glassdoor let employees and interviewees publish anonymous reviews or interview experiences of the employers. </li>
<li>I use this website when I am doing research on the company that I am interested in, often before the information and on-site interviews.</li>
</ul>

    <h2>Useful websites - Crunchbase (Startup Funding DB)</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li>Crunchbase has a fairly comprehensive list of start-ups fund-raising.</li>
<li>Judging from last funding and employee size, you can gauge the length of the runway.</li>
<li>Useful for start ups; not necessarily so for public companies (you can often find more publicly-available information)</li>

    <h2>A Data Scientist&#39;s Interview</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>&quot;Data science interviews are the worst because data science is interdisciplinary: code for &#39;you have to know everything about all the disciplines.&#39;  Depending on the company and the team, your interview might look like a software developer’s interview, or it might look a like a statistician&#39;s interview, and the bad news is that virtually none of the material overlaps.&quot; -- <a href="http://www.erinshellman.com/crushed-it-landing-a-data-science-job/">Erin Shellman</a></p>

<li>Data Engineering / System Architecture</li>
<li>Software Engineering</li>
<li>Domain Knowledge (aka. Subject Matter Expertise)</li>
<li>Business Acumen and Communication</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Action:</strong> Know your skill profile, your interest, and know what the company is looking for during earlier rounds of interviews. If you found yourself lacking on aspects that the company absolutely need, it&#39;s not a good fit.</p>

    <h2>Coding Challenge</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <p>You are expected to solve some computation or data manipulation problem, using a language of your choice. Ideally, your solution not only have to be correct, but also have to scale well. If you can solve a problem in \(O(n)\) time, don’t solve it in \(O(n^2)\). </p>

<p><strong>Action:</strong> play with <a href="http://www.hackerrank.com">HackerRank</a> or <a href="http://www.leetcode.com">leetcode</a>. But don&#39;t go overboard! Data Scientist&#39;s algorithm interview is often not as hard-core as that of a software engineer. (but YMMV - your mileage might vary)</p>

  <hgroup>
    <h2>Data Analysis Challenge</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li><p>Test your skills on data manipulation, cleaning, and predictive modeling. The questions often contain both descriptive and predictive components. </p>

<ul>
<li>Descriptive: What is the average amount of time a bike spends at a station?</li>
<li>Predictive: predict # of bikes arriving at each station during a specific time span.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Things to know:</p>

<ul>
<li>You often can stick with simpler models (e.g. linear or logistic regression), but be prepared to rationalize the choices you made on model selection.</li>
<li>Your goal was not only on the data munging and modeling, but also provide a written document to explain, in laymen’s terms, what you have found. - Data scientists often have to communicate the results with other non-technical audiences.</li>
<li>You must be able to analyze data with code (e.g. R/Rmarkdown, python / ipython notebook).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Action:</strong> Play with <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic">kaggle Titanic challenge</a> to understand the type of questions that may be asked in a data analysis challenge.</p>

    <h2>Technical Interview (Phone or On-site)</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li><p>The questions ranges widely depending on the interviewer, the company, and the position you are applying to. Understand your audience and get an idea of what they are looking for.</p></li>
<li><p>No matter what the questions are asked, it is important to make the interview &quot;interactive&quot;. You are talking with a live human being, so most of the time, you not only have to solve the problems correctly, but also have to &quot;think out loud&quot; so that the interviewer can follow your line of thought. This is the conversational version of &quot;show your work&quot;. </p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Action:</strong> conduct mock-up interviews with your friends and colleagues. Know your audience and understand what the company is looking for; but also accept the fact that you probably won&#39;t expect any of the questions.</p>

    <h2>Business Case Interviews</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li><p>Only some companies have this. You should only prepare for it if you are pretty certain that this will be included in the interview.</p></li>
<li><p>The questions ranges from more number-specific (break-even analysis: given the following assumptions on fixed and variable costs, how many units of product do you need to sell to break even?) to more open ended questions that involved a lot of back‐and-forth discussions with the interviewers (example: imagine that you have access to half of the US credit card transaction data. How do you use this data to consult your client, a big cafe chain, on which city in US to open their new branches?)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Action: checkout <a href="http://www.capitalone.com/careers/analyst/assessment/">case interview tutorials</a> available on line, which gives you a flavor of the questions that may be involved.</p>

    <h2>Behavioral Interview:</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li><p>The behavioral questions are asked to figure out if you work will with others, how you handle conflicts, etc. Employers wants to know you behaved in the past in order to predict your future with them. </p></li>
<li><p>When you answer this kind of question, it is important to think of examples that back up your answer. Saying &quot;I work well with others&quot;&quot; is one thing; saying &quot;in my last project I worked with three different research groups to bring the project to completion&quot; is much better.</p></li>
<li><p>One popular approach to is to use the STAR (Situation / Task / Action / Result) format. There are a wide array of internet resources available on this topic. </p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Action:</strong> google &quot;behavioral interview&quot; and understand the STAR format. Think about your past experiences and come up with answers for some popular questions (teamwork, conflict resolution, biggest strengths and weaknesses, etc.)</p>

  <hgroup>
    <h2>Your question for them:</h2>
  </hgroup>
  <article data-timings="">
    <ul>
<li><p>A job interview is a two-way process in which two parties (you and your potential employer) decide if they want to &quot;go steady&quot;. Once you take their job offer you may spend months to years with them, so this is not a decision to be taken lightly.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure you have done some research on the company (and the interviewers if you have time) before your on‐site interview, so that the Q&amp;A time can be spent on things that aren&#39;t public knowledge.</p></li>
<li><p>Well-thought and well-prepared questions for them will:</p>

<ul>
<li>shows them that you are genuinely interested in the job and the company (and have done your homework before the interview)</li>
<li>provide you the best chance to collect information to make an informed decision.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Having no questions at all does NOT show well - you will be passed as not-prepared, not-interested, or both.</p></li>
